# ipl_player_score_prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict IPL batsman scores based on historical ball-by-ball data. By leveraging regression algorithms, feature engineering, and ensemble learning, the model aims to provide accurate run predictions for players under different match conditions.
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Processed 1095 JSON files containing 200,000+ ball-by-ball data points from IPL matches.
	â€¢	Engineered 12+ statistical features, including batting average, strike rate, venue-based trends, and opposition economy rates.
	â€¢	Evaluated Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving the best performance with:
	â€¢	Linear Regression: RÂ² = 0.5124, MAE = 10.344
	â€¢	Random Forest: RÂ² = 0.5005, MAE = 9.87 (after hyperparameter tuning)
	â€¢	XGBoost: RÂ² = 0.5114, MAE = 9.94 (after hyperparameter tuning)
	â€¢	Improved model accuracy by 12% through RandomizedSearchCV-based hyperparameter tuning.
	â€¢	Compared stacked ensemble models but found that Linear Regression outperformed them by 3% in RÂ² score.
 ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
	â€¢	Programming: Python
	â€¢	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	â€¢	ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
	â€¢	Techniques: Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning, Ensemble Learning
 ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
	â€¢	Incorporate detailed feature engineering, including:
	â€¢	Shot type, ball type, field placements, bowler stats, fielder stats, weather conditions, and other dynamic factors to make the model more consistent and adaptable for ensemble learning.
	â€¢	Improve the modelâ€™s accuracy to achieve MAE below 5, ensuring higher prediction reliability.
	â€¢	Develop a web-based card game where users collect player cards, with stats dynamically updating based on the playerâ€™s recent form.
	â€¢	Integrate real-time match data to predict the number of runs a player is expected to score in the next match.
